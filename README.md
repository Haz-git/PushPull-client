# PushPull (Client-Side/Front-End)
A *fitness programming* web-app created for rapid prototyping of workout-related programs and serve as a fitness community.

- This repository houses the client-side of my web application *PushPull*. As such, most of the details mentioned here are largely front-end related. If you want to learn about my API (server-side) please visit [PushPull's server-side repository](https://github.com/Haz-git/PushPull-server).

### About The Project
---
*PushPull* is my newest passion project designed for the rapid creation of fitness programs for distribution. Whether fitness trainer, professional bodybuilder, or just a general fitness enthusiast like me-- I wanted PushPull to serve as a centralized community where people can create, search, rate, and discuss a variety of workout programs.

During my fitness journey, I jumped from one workout program to another when the time felt right. I perused Reddit for hours to find the best workout programs for my current level. Then, after long contemplation, I visited multiple sketchy blog websites to find and download that fitness program. My dislike toward this process led to the creation of *PushPull*
